# Acrylic case

This case has two versions:

- The **one-piece** make use of laser engraving and just one sheet of at least 3mm thick acrylic, in the configuration it will add 1mm to the board height
- The **two-pieces** case are unfinished.

**I've noted that when opened in some softwares the overall size of the case changes, the ideal size is 109.4mm.**

## One-piece

| Quantity | What                                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 2        | Laser engraved acrylic 3mm               |
| 12       | Heat insert M2(OD 3.2mm) 2mm lenght |
| 12       | Screw M2 4mm lenght                 |
| 12       | Brass washer M2 0.4mm height        |
| 12       | Neodymium magnets 5mm x 5mm x 2mm   |

The parts of the archive inked in black need to be engraved in 2mm deep. As the people that do laser cut usually don't know their exact kerf width I assumed something around [0.18mm](https://cutlasercut.com/drawing-resources/expert-tips/laser-kerf/) in the heat inserts (2.7mm + (0.18mm\*2) = 3.06mm). All the remaining cuts are not ajusted for kerf.

## Two-pieces - Unfinished

| Quantity | What                                |
| -------- | ----------------------------------- |
| 2        | Laser cut acrylic 2mm back          |
| 2        | Laser cut acrylic 2mm middle        |
| 12       | Heat insert M2(OD 3.2mm) 2mm lenght |
| 12       | Screw M2 5mm lenght                 |

## How to make it better

The laser kerf width can be ajusted to get a more precise finish. You can use inkscape offset path effect to do that based on the kerf value provided by the manufacture.

You can add recess for the rubber feet. The best option is to do this based on the rubber feet you find.
